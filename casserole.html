            <p>A layer of softly shredded zucchini, sauce, cheese, <br>
                pepperoni, and sliced bell pepper is placed on top <br>
                of the traditional toppings. Try out your favorite <br>
                toppings, but be careful not to overfill the crust <br>
                because it might make it soggy.</p><br>
                
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>4 cups shredded zucchini (2 medium)</li>
                <li>4 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
                <li>¼ cup finely chopped onion</li>
                <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour or gluten-free all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 cup canned crushed tomatoes</li>
                <li>¼ cup thinly sliced fresh basil</li>
                <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon pepper</li>
                <li>1 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>½ cup thinly sliced green bell pepper</li>
                <li>1 ounce pepperoni slices (1/4 cup)</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Coat a 9-by-13-inch <br>
                    baking dish with cooking spray. Place zucchini in <br>
                    the center of a clean kitchen towel and wring out <br>
                    the excess moisture. Transfer to a bowl and combine <br>
                    with eggs, onion, Parmesan and flour. Pour the mixture <br>
                    into the prepared baking dish and spread into an <br>
                    even layer. Bake until set and beginning to brown <br>
                    around the edges, about 30 minutes.</li><br>
                
                <li>Meanwhile, combine tomatoes, basil, garlic, salt and <br>
                    pepper in a medium bowl. When the zucchini crust is <br>
                    done, spread the sauce evenly over the top. Top with <br>
                    mozzarella, bell pepper and pepperoni. Return to the oven <br>
                    and bake until the cheese is melted and the sauce is <br>
                    heated through, about 15 minutes. Let cool for about <br>
                    5 minutes before serving.</li><br>
            </ol>
